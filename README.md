This is just a lousy attempt at making a chrome plugin to replace the word 
Donald Trump with "Stupid".

HOW TO LOAD IT:

a) Git clone this repo - git clone https://github.com/faizabidi/chrome_plugin.git <br/>
b) Open a Chrome Tab and go to "chrome://extensions/" <br/>
c) Click on "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to the git repo and hit "Select".<br/>
d) If it worked, you should be able to see a small plugin icon at the top right corner of the tab with a photo that looks like Donald Trump. <br/>
e) That's it! Try going to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump to see the effect. <br/>

NOTE: I didn't realize it before but there is already such plugins on the Chrome Store.
