This is just a lousy attempt at making a chrome plugin to replace the word 
Donald Trump with "Stupid".

HOW TO LOAD IT:

a) Git clone this repo - git clone https://github.com/faizabidi/chrome_plugin.git
b) Open a Chrome Tab and go to "chrome://extensions/"
c) Click on "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to the git repo and hit "Select". 
d) If it worked, you should be able to see a small extension icon at the top right corner of the tab with a photo that looks like Donald Trump.
e) That's it! Try going to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump to see the effect.
